<p>Alavia (pronounced “uh-love-ya” and/or “uh-luh-vi-ya”) is a Muslim American residing on the east coast of the United States. She is well-versed in all things Harry Potter and although she is an enthusiast of all baked goods, she is most definitely a cookie monster. Her hobbies include globetrotting, watching too much television, shamelessly loving pop music, and documenting everything that ever happens in her life. She’s also a massive Duke basketball fan. Her favorite kind of cookie is freshly baked chocolate chip, and you should send her some immediately. Oh and she's also the May 2017 Kode With Klossy Career Scholar!</p>
