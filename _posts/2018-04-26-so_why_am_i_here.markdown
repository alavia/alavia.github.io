In other words, why am I learning to code?

I’ve always wanted to make a positive impact in the world. It might sound cliche, but it’s the truth. Although there are countless ways to do that, I decided that the best way for me to make a difference is through code. There are so many organizations out there that are doing incredible, life-changing work that need their developers as much as they need their teams on the ground. Knowing how to code would allow me to help build exactly what all sorts of organizations need to operate as efficiently as possible. It can give me the power to build anything that comes to mind and let creativity be my guide. I don’t know exactly what I want to create yet; maybe it’ll be something that changes the world or maybe something that solves the tiniest problem. Let's be real, the world is full of problems and its only right if I do my part in solving some. Whatever it may be, I want to equip myself with the knowledge and tools to be able to do it. 

I graduated from college with a degree in Biological Sciences, and our world is learning and growing at such a rapid pace with technology being integrated into every field. It’s very clear that tech already plays a huge role in the sciences. Learning how to code could help me bring both worlds together and have a better understanding of them for myself.

I’m also a huge advocate for women and girls in STEM, so what better way to promote the cause than to be a woman in tech myself? I really want to make connections with fellow women in tech (and male allies!) so that we can support one another along our journeys. It’s so important to me to encourage girls to pursue careers in STEM fields. After all, who run the world? (GIRLS. duh.)

Lastly, the flexibility that working as a developer can provide is definitely not the worst thing in the world. I love to travel and being able to work remotely would be really great for me.

I'm thrilled to be here and I'm so excited to see where my coding journey takes me!
